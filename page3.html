                nd so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room 
                depends on a variation of shadows, heavy shadows against light 
                shadows-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity 
                of Japanese rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft 
                of ornament. Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure 
                to comprehend the mystery of shadows. Out beyond the sitting room, 
                which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the 
                eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a 
                remove. The light from the garden steals in but dimly through 
                paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that 
                makes for us the charm of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors 
                so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. 

                The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, 
                but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured 
                with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty 
                of the feeble light. We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow 
                of fading rays clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out
                what little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for to us 
                this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And so, as
                we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand 
                in a single neutral color. The hue may differ from room to room, but the 
                degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in 
                color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood
                of the viewer. And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, 
                the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.
