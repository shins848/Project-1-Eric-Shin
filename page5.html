            Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the paper-paneled 
            shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove where it is 
            darkest. Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, 
            I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of
            shadow and light. For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever 
            device. An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that 
            the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. There is nothing 
            more. And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, 
            around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is
             mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the 
             atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness 
             immutable tranquility holds sway. The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners 
             speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places. And even we 
             as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths of 
             an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the key to this 
             mystery? illtimately it is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished 
             from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.

            This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from this 
            empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that formed there a quality 
            of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament. The 
            technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. We can imagine 
            with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with each invisible 
            detail-the placement of the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the 
            crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch 
            is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay; I need only pause before 
            it and I forget the passage of time.
