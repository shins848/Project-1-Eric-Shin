            How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. 
            But I see why in ancient times statues of the Buddha were gilt with gold and why 
            gold leaf covered the walls of the homes of the nobility. Modem man, in his well-lit 
            house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; but those who lived in the dark houses
            of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty, they also knew its practical 
            value; for gold, in these dim rooms, must have served the function of a reflector. 
            Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. Its reflective 
            properties were put to use as a source of illumination. Silver and other metals 
            quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light 
            the darkness of the room. This is why gold was held in such incredibly high esteem.
