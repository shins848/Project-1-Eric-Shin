                f course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it
                a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers
                serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows. We value a 
                scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and 
                thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or 
                painting. Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if
                it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular 
                distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected 
                advantage both itself and its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an 
                otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? Most often the paper, 
                the ink, the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, 
                and this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the 
                darkness of the alcove and room.

                We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of 
                Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging
                in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these alcoves, even in bright
                daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do
                is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but
                invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must 
                be. Yet the combination of that blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one 
                of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather 
                to suit the painting perfectly.

                For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which 
                the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely the same function as the 
                sand-textured wall. This is why we attach such importance to age and patina. 
                A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite 
                destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.
