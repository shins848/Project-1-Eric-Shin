                he study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window 
                built to provide a place for reading. Over the years it came to be regarded 
                as no more than a source of light for the alcove; but most often it serves 
                not so much to illuminate the alcove as to soften the sidelong rays from without,
                to filter them through paper panels. There is a cold and desolate tinge to the 
                light by the time it reaches these panels. The little sunlight from the garden 
                that manages to make its way beneath the eaves and through the corridors has by
                then lost its power to illuminate, seems drained of the complexion of life. It
                can do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. I sometimes linger
                before these panels and study the surface of the paper, bright, but giving no
                impression of brilliance.

                In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance from the 
                garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season, on fair days or 
                cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale, white glow scarcely varies. And the 
                shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely immobile, as if dust collected 
                in the corners had become a part of the paper itself. I blink in uncertainty at this 
                dreamlike luminescence, feeling as though some misty film were blunting my vision. 
                The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the 
                alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness, creating a world of confusion where dark
                 and light are indistinguishable. Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the 
                 light that suffuses such a room, a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light? 
                 Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless, a fear that in that 
                 room you might lose all consciousness of the passage of time, that untold years 
                 might pass and upon emerging you should find you had grown old and gray?

                And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge
                buildings, to which sunlight never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door
                or screen will pick up a distant glimmer from the garden, then suddenly send forth
                an ethereal glow, a faint golden light cast into the enveloping darkness, like
                the glow upon the horizon at sunset. In no other setting is gold quite so
                exquisitely beautiful. You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; and
                as you move away the golden surface of the paper glows ever more deeply, changing
                not in a flash, but growing slowly, steadily brighter, like color rising in the
                face of a giant. Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which
                until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move past, suddenly
                gleam forth as if it had burst into flame.
